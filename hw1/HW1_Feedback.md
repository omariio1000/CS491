## Comments
Good work getting your VM setup!
 
In the future please include your OdinID in your screenshots. This can be done with a sticky note app, typing it into the search bar, editing it into your screenshots, etc. You will lose points if this is not done moving forward. 

Also, please include documentation for every task in the assignment. I'm assuming you were able to get OpenVPN to work, becuase there is nothing written saying you struggled to set it up.
