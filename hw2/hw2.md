`objdump` disassembles the file and shows the headers used and all the assembly code for all the functions. This can be configured with options.

## b
`nm` shows all the symbols from the file. It can also be configured with options.

## b
`readelf` shows information about one or more ELF format object files. It can also be configured with options.

## a
The `grep -Ev $(...)` portion is designed to exclude lines containing any user names from `/etc/passwd`. This is useful for filtering out system or regular user processes to focus on processes run by users not normally present in the `passwd` fileâ€”potentially highlighting unauthorized or unexpected user activities.

## b
An alias in Unix/Linux is a shorthand or a nickname for a command or a series of commands. It allows a user to customize, shorten, or simplify command sequences. Aliases are often defined in the shell's configuration files like .`bashrc` or `.zshrc` to increase productivity or enhance usability.

## c
Yes, the `awk '{print $1}'` can be replaced with cut `-d' ' -f1`

`ps -efH --no-header | cut -d' ' -f1 | ...`

The reverse is also true; cut can be replaced by `awk` since `awk` is more powerful and can handle more complex text processing tasks than cut.


## d
`paste` is typically used to merge lines of files side by side. However, for this pipeline, replacing Python might involve a different approach since `paste` itself doesn't inherently filter or format input like Python. But you can simplify the Python command by directly using `paste` to streamline combining lines:

`grep -Ev $(cut -f1 -d':' /etc/passwd | paste -sd'|' -)`

Here, `paste -sd'|' -` takes the output of `cut`, which lists user names line by line, and merges them into a single line separated by `|`. This can then be fed into `grep` directly, replacing the Python script used for joining strings.
