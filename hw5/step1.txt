Phase 2: 1 2 6 24 120 720

It starts by calling read_six_numbers with the address of var_18 (a local variable) and storing the six numbers there.
It then checks if the first number (at var_18) is equal to 1. If not, it calls explode_bomb.
Next, it initializes ebx to 1 and esi to the address of var_18.
A loop runs from ebx = 1 to ebx = 5 (inclusive):
It calculates eax as ebx + 1 multiplied by the number at esi + ebx*4 - 4 (the previous number in the array).
It compares this result with the current number in the array (esi + ebx*4). If they are not equal, it calls explode_bomb.
It increments ebx.
Understanding the Loop
Let's break down the loop conditions:
For ebx = 1, it checks:
eax = (1 + 1) * var_18[0] which is 2 * 1 = 2
This must be equal to var_18[1]
For ebx = 2, it checks:
eax = (2 + 1) * var_18[1] which is 3 * 2 = 6
This must be equal to var_18[2]
For ebx = 3, it checks:
eax = (3 + 1) * var_18[2] which is 4 * 6 = 24
This must be equal to var_18[3]
For ebx = 4, it checks:
eax = (4 + 1) * var_18[3] which is 5 * 24 = 120
This must be equal to var_18[4]
For ebx = 5, it checks:
eax = (5 + 1) * var_18[4] which is 6 * 120 = 720
This must be equal to var_18[5]

Choose case 0, then char is q and dec is 777

6 nodes, check

0x8048e75 <phase_6+221> cmp    (%edx),%eax
0x8048e77 <phase_6+223> jge    0x8048e7e <phase_6+230> 

eax is previous node and edx is current and eax is previous. current must be less than previous otherwise it will blow up.
